Algorithm 3: Water Wave Optimization (WWO)
Purpose
Algorithm 3 optimizes the assignment of orders to workers using the Water Wave Optimization technique. Starting with initial feasible solutions (from Algorithm 2), it iteratively refines them to find the best possible assignment, maximizing worker profit while minimizing service time.
Key Steps
1.	Initialize
o	Load initial solutions (P) from a file (generated by Algorithm 2).
o	Select the best solution (X*) using a fitness function.
2.	Iterative Improvement
o	Propagation: Make small random changes to explore new solutions.
o	Evaluation: Compare new solutions with the current best.
o	Update: If a better solution is found, update X* and P.
3.	Neighborhood Search
o	Perform additional local searches around X* for further refinement.
4.	Termination
o	Stop after a set number of iterations.
5.	Output
o	Return the best assignment (X*) found.
Inputs
1.	Orders (O): List of order IDs.
2.	Workers (W): List of worker IDs.
3.	Maximum Service Time (s_max): Maximum allowable service time, calculated in Algorithm 1.
4.	Worker Capacity (q_w): Maximum capacity per worker (set to 1 for each).
5.	Service Times: Actual service times for each order-worker pair, calculated in Algorithm 2.
6.	Delivery Costs: Costs for each order-worker pair, calculated in Algorithm 1.
7.	Estimated Profits: Estimated profits for each order-worker pair, calculated in Algorithm 1.
8.	Population Size (P_size): Optional number of initial solutions (from Algorithm 2).
9.	Maximum Iterations (max_iter): Optional maximum number of iterations.
Output
â€¢	Optimal Assignment (X*): The best assignment of orders to workers, maximizing profits while minimizing service time.
