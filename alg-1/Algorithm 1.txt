Algorithm 1
1. Purpose 
This algorithm aims to optimize the route and calculate the time and cost for a worker. It uses an iterative process to visit locations, either picking up or delivering orders while keeping track of the worker's travel time and cost. Finally, it calculates the total time and cost for the worker based on these movements.
2. Steps in the Algorithm
1. Initialize Service Time and Cost:
Initialize the estimated service time (esj,k) and delivery cost (ecj,k) to 0 for all orders in J_k.
2. Construct the Total Workload Set:
 Create an undelivered order set J'_k which includes all pending orders and combine it with the current orders in J_k.
3. Extract Locations:
 Extract all locations of interest from the orders (pickup and delivery locations) into a list L_k.
4. Initialize Location Visit Flags:
Initialize a visit flag (V_l) for each location in L_k to track whether the worker has visited that location.
5.  Calculate Distances:
Define the distances between all pairs of locations in L_k.
6. Initialize Loop Variables:
Set the worker's current location to lk and initialize a counter c to track the number of locations visited.
7. Loop Through Locations:
 Continue iterating until all locations in L_k are visited.
In each iteration, identify the nearest unvisited location l0 and handle either a pickup or delivery for the associated order.
8. Handle Pickup:
If the worker is at the pickup location for an order j, update the service time and cost by adding the travel time and other service-related costs.
9. Handle Delivery:
If the worker is at the delivery location for an order j and has already visited the pickup location, update the service time and cost similarly.
10. Update Loop Variables:
Mark the current location as visited and continue the loop until all locations are visited.
11. Calculate Total Service Time and Cost:
 After the loop, sum the individual service times (esj,k) and costs (ecj,k) for all orders to get the worker’s total estimated service time (eS_k) and delivery cost (eC_k).
3. Inputs
- Jk: Set of orders assigned to worker k.
- Each order includes:
- Pickup location (lp_j)
- Delivery location (ld_j)
- Associated service times and costs.
- Distance function (d(l, l')): Provides the distance between two locations.
- Constants:
- Cet: Represents constants related to estimated times.
- x: A cost constant, potentially related to fuel or vehicle wear-and-tear.
4. Outputs
- eS_k: Total estimated service time for worker k after serving all assigned orders.
- eC_k: Total estimated delivery cost for worker k based on the distances traveled for all assigned orders.
